Project
Our Team was given the project by our client to Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app was designed to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  
The client requested that the calender be made to cover a normal business day, we decided to make the app encompass a longer duration instead because many business such as oil and gas must have 24 hour coverage requiring the average employee to work 12 to 17 hour shifts with overtime
This simple calendar application allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library was incorporated in the assignment to work with date and time. The documentation Moment.js was used in the browser.
